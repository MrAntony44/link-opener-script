# link-opener-script
This is a small project I created to open the links of my lessons automatically, removing the need for me to find the lessons I had each hour and search for the links.  
The script would run automatically on a cronjob I had scheduled and would open the lesson according to the programme you feed it in the config file.  
It is pretty rough but a good solution if you want to open links automatically at selected times each day.  
In the design process, I tried make it seem like an assistant, so at the first hour every day, an HTML table pops up showing you the day programme.  
Also, a notification will display(if you are using windows), showing you what lesson you are currently joining and also the next lesson.

There is a lot of room for improvement, but I am not planning on improving the script in any way; it worked just fine for me and I hope it does the same for you!
